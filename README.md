# Networking lab

Welcome to my Real-World Networking Lab Repository! This repository serves as a testament to my dedication to networking excellence and a valuable resource for those eager to dive into the world of real, hands-on networking.

About Me
I'm [Your Name], a passionate networking enthusiast with a firm belief in the power of experiential learning. As I pursue my goal of achieving the coveted CCNP (Cisco Certified Network Professional) certification, I am thrilled to share with you my networking lab projects. What sets these projects apart is the fact that they are conducted on actual Cisco hardware, not in the confines of a virtual environment.

Real Gear, Real Learning
In my lab, I've invested in real Cisco equipment to create an environment that closely mimics the challenges and intricacies of real-world networking. Currently, my lab boasts the following gear:

2 Cisco Catalyst 3750 Switches
1 Cisco 2800 Series Router
4 Raspberry Pi 3B+ Devices
This authentic hardware setup enables me to explore, test, and document networking concepts, configurations, and best practices in an environment that reflects the conditions networking professionals face in their daily work.

What You'll Find Here
Within this repository, you'll discover a collection of networking lab projects covering a diverse range of networking topics. These projects are not simulations; they are tangible and practical experiences, meticulously documented to help you grasp the nuances of each setup. From routing and switching to security and virtualization, each project is designed to provide hands-on insights.

How You Can Benefit
